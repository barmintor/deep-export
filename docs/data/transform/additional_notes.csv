135,"The imprint on surviving copies is cropped, but Greg writes that ""it can still be read with reasonable confidence"" (<i>Bibliography</i> 2:570)."
136,"The title page is cropt at the bottom of the surviving copies, so it is unclear if there was originally an imprint. The end of the text states that the workmanship for the pageant was done by ""M. Gerard Chrismas"" [C2v]."
137,"There is no evidence that this play was ever acted, but Davenant may have written it with the intention that it would eventually be performed by a professional playing company."
138,"There is another undated edition of this play, which was printed after 1660 and therefore not included in DEEP."
139,"<i>Annals</i> gives the date of Henry Herbert's license for the stage as September 17, but it is actually from April 17 (see N. W. Bawcutt, <i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 151)."

145,"Greg writes, ""This edition was evidently printed to take the place"" of the first edition of the play printed for the second volume of Jonson's <i>Works</i>, but he adds, ""it is also clear from advertisements ... that copies were sold separately (although none are recorded as now occurring in that state) and it is therefore here treated as an independent edition"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:605-6). There is another issue of this playbook from 1669 [Greg 457b(ii)], which is not included in DEEP."
146,"The play was performed on Mar 19, 1632, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning."
147,"According to Greg, ""This edition appears to have been printed to accompany the Oxford collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, with which it is often bound up, but of which it is neither an integral part nor an invariable companion, and the mention of a Cambridge bookseller in the imprint proves the intention of separate issue. Three years later the remaining stock was included as part of the London collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, 1643, being replaced when exhausted by a reprint dated 1646 [469d]"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618)."
148,"According to Greg, ""This edition was printed for the later issue of"" the 1643 Randolph collection ""after the stock of [469c] was exhausted"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618). It does not seem to have been intended for separate issue."
149,"This play was likely performed by the Red Bull (Revels) Company, but the title page attribution seems to be to the Children of the Queen's Revels; DEEP therefore classifies it under both Adult Professional and Boys Professional."

155,"The masque was performed on Feb 24, 1636, so the title page dates follow the legal reckoning.  The end of the text states that ""The Musick of the Songs and Symphanies were excellent compos'd by M<sup>r</sup>. Henry, and M<sup>r</sup>. William Laws, his Majesties Servants"" [C4r]."
156,"The masque was performed on Feb 27, 1636, so the imprint date follows the legal reckoning."

158,"The end of the text states that the music was ""compos'd by Symon Ive"" [B2r]."
159,"The description notes that the country and other ""rude"" dances were made by ""Simon Hopper"" [A3r], and the music ""excellently compos'd by Master Charles Coleman"" [D4r]."

165,"The bookseller name is from STC, as is the identification of John Dawson (2) as the printer of the cancel title page for this issue."
166,"Greg writes that this edition was intended to be included in the 1646 edition of <i>Fragmenta Aurea</i>, but he adds, ""The alternative imprints, however, may point to an original intention to issue the play separately, and it came, moreover, from a different press from any other part of the volume. Separate copies are occasionally found, but whether they were issued so is uncertain"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:681)."
167,"Greg writes that copies of this edition ""are occasionally found apart from the rest of the collection, but there is no reason to suppose that they were issued separately"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:682). There is no Wing number for this bibliographically independent edition of <i>Aglaura</i>; Wing catalogues it only as part of the collection S6127."

170,"Greg writes that separate editions of <i>Cleopatra</i> and <i>Julia Agrippina</i> ""were printed in 1639, but since the epistle to Sir Kenelm Digby prefixed to <i>Cleopatra</i> is a joint dedication of the two plays, it is clear that these, though otherwise bibliographically distinct, were intended to be issued together as well as separately"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1092). DEEP lists each of these plays only as a single-play playbook, not as part of a collection."
171,"Greg writes, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1092: ""Separate editions of the two plays [553, 554] were printed in 1639, but since the epistle to Sir Kenelm Digby prefixed to <i>Cleopatra</i> is a joint dedication of the two plays, it is clear that these, though otherwise bibliographically distinct, were intended to be issued together as well as separately.""

227,"Greg writes, ""This piece is bibliographically independent, and the advertisements that occur both before and after it in the collection serve to emphasize the fact. ... It would appear, therefore, that this single piece was meant to be issued separately in advance of the collection. On the other hand, the date on the title, 1659, shows that it was actually printed later than the other four plays, which are all dated 1658; and since the collection appears to have been on the market by January ..., there can have been little time for previous issue; moreover, the fact that no copies have been met with apart from the collection makes it unlikely that any such independent issue was made"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:909)."

It seems more likely, however, that when the copy for the latter [312a] was received the type of the four sheets of the earlier issue [311a(*)] was still standing, and that advantage was taken of the fact to print a further impression [311a(†)] ... and append new matter to it"" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:455)."

269,"This collection was apparently intended to contain ten plays; it lacks a general title page but does begin with a joint title, transcribed here, for the first two plays, <i>2</i> and <i>3 Henry the Sixth</i>, and continuous signatures for these two and the third play, <i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i>. The other plays apparently intended for inclusion in the collection were: <i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Henry the Fifth</i>, <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i>, and <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>."

The third volume ""was printed for and presumably published by Thomas Walkley (though [Andrew] Crooke and John Benson both claimed interest in some of the copies it included)"" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1075); it was the subject of a Bill in Chancery in January 1641, which records ""a great deal about the circumstances of publication"" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1081)."

301,"The date in the HT is an error. <i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this masque to July 19(?), 1620, but Martin Butler convincingly argues it should be January 6, 1621 (""Ben Jonson's <i>Pan's Anniversary</i> and the Politics of Early Stuart Pastoral,"" <i>English Literary Renaissance</i>, 22 [1992]: 369-404)."
