## What is this?
This is an experiment in packaging small humanities datasets up with [Lovefield](https://google.github.io/lovefield/).

The development data here is seeded with <a href="http://deep.sas.upenn.edu/">data from <img alt="DEEP" style="height:20px" src="http://deep.sas.upenn.edu/images/deep_logo.jpg" />, created by Alan B. Farmer and Zachary Lesser</a>.

## How do I run it?
Clone the repo, switch to the docs directory and run something like:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
